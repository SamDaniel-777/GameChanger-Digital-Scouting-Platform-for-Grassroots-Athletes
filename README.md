# GameChanger â€“Digital Scouting Platform for Grassroots Athletes
GameChanger is a modern, TypeScript + Next.js-based digital scouting platform built to empower grassroots athletesâ€”especially from developing countries like India. 
Due to limited funding, political bias, and lack of exposure, many talented players never get discovered. GameChanger solves this by allowing athletes to:
- Showcase their profiles and performance highlights
- Get digitally discovered by scouts
- Request funding and opportunities
Scouts can evaluate athlete profiles remotely and invite them for trialsâ€”just like LinkedIn does for jobs, but this is purpose-built for sports.
ðŸ’¡This project is designed to scale with AI integrations in the future, enabling smarter matchmaking between athletes and recruiters.
